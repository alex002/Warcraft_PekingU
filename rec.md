However, lower radiation dose reduces the x-ray photons that reaches the detector, thus lowering the signal strength and negatively affect the image quality, and consequently affect the diagnosis.  This raise a question to the research community: how to achieve better image quality at low dose. Many efforts has been made on the imaging hardware, including better detector, phase-contrast imaging, and innovative imaging geometry. As hardware is heavily constrainted by the physics, the improvement in imaging hardware is slow. Recent advances in software, mainly the image reconstruction and processing algorithms, have shine a light into this dilima. Statistically modeling incorporated with prior knowledge and efficient iterative algorithm has shown to be able to recover information that is not captured by the hardware, and the reconstruction from the statistical iterative reconstruction has demonstrated a superior image quality over the conventional FBP reconstruction. The only drawback is that such iterative reconstruction is time consuming, which is not practical in clinical setting. For digital tomosynthesis where the measured data are insufficient and truncated, the iterative reconstruction can greatly improve the final image quality which in terms benefits the diagnostic accuracy. 

The adapted fan volume reconstruction that we developed for the stationary tomosynthesis systems can dramatically improves the reconstruction speed. In our result, we observed 30 to 50 timesâ€™ speed up compared to the conventional 3D cone beam reconstruction on a six-cores desktop. Several aspects contribute to this improvement. First, each fan volume can be treated as independent to the adjacent fan volume. Therefore, each fan voluem reconstruction can be carried out separately, enabling a straightforward parallelization. Utilizing this advantage, we speed up the reconstruction by 6 times through parallel computing on MATLAB. Secondly, as the size of each reconstruction in AFVR is smaller than that in conventional cone-beam reconstruction, the size of the system matrix is dramatically reduced. Therefore, we are able to store the system matrix in the memory. This avoids the computation of the forward projector in each iteration, and reduces the reconstruction time. In addition,     

AFVR is designed for linear tomosynthesis, and it will not reconstruct images for conventional tomosynthesis systems with a curved line source motion, as generally the source positions in those systems will be different in height. This picture becomes clearer when one thinks of two source positions and connect them with one randomly-choosed detector row. The connections create two planes in the 3D space, each consists the same detector row but different sources. Since these source positions have different height, the two planes will cut the image space differently, or in another word, one voxel cut or included by the one plane might not be cut (included) in another plane. As a result, the value of those voxels can no longer be entirely determined by the projection data of a single detector row. With that being said, there is data redundancy even in the conventional tomosynthesis imaging (The value of one voxel is fully determined by only a fraction of the measurement), and one might be able to use that characteristic to designed an algorithm to speed up the reconstruction.

In this study, we used a FBP-based commercial software, RTT, to compare with the AFVR. While RTT can be used for a general tomosynthesis reconstruction, it is designed and optimized for the breast imaging. Therefore, it might not be fair to compare image quality between RTT and the proposed AFVR algorithm when reconstructing for a different imaging system. In addition, as a commercial software, RTT may consist proprietary imaging processing besides the reconstruction, which may affect the final reconstruction image. Therefore, our result may not apply to a general setting, i.e. the difference in image quality between AFVR and FBP reconstruction. Currently, the AFVR is coupled with SIRT, which is relatively simple and the reconstruction image quality is generally believed to be mediocre. We expect that the image quality can be further improved by incorporating a more sophisticate statistical model with AFVR.
