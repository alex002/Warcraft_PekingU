Major revision.



1. Some machine learning algorithms, such as random forest, gradient boosting, and neural network, are also good at classifying data, especially for complicated problems.  What are the benefits of using this scoring system comparing to the use of ML classifiers?

2. Validation analysis of this scoring system. 

3. For the score value of the optic nerve diameter (diameter >= mean + 1 SD), there is no need to have a 0.5 value here as no other metric have a 0.5 score.  The author can think of using 3 instead of 2.5 for consistency (and it would not affect the final   

4. Demographic info of the patient.  Will the diameter differ for different genders, or patients at different ages?

5. For the optic nerve diameter, do authors expect the user to measure and determine the SD? If not, I would suggest the author I will simply put a diameter value instead of the SD for the optic nerve diameter metric.

Regarding the score metric for optic nerve tortuosity: can the first four metrics be observed at the same time (interruption w/ retun, interruption w/ return, lack of congruity, and axial deviation)?
